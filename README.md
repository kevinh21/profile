## My process
I created a basic layout and used React Router 5 initially.  I converted to version 6 to be sure I was up to date with the most current version.  This is important because the site will be evolving over time and I want to be able compatible with the newest tech.
### Built with
- Custom CSS, JavaScript, React, Router, Gimp, Node, Express, Visual Studio Code, GitHub.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [JavaScript]
- [Gimp]
- [Visual Studio Code]

### What I learned
Being that this is a aggregate of projects, I can say that I've learned about many aspects of React and Development best practices.  For example, where to store stylesheets, how to name and when to use classnames vs. id for styles. I learned how to connect and creat API's and database connections, useState, useEffect, context, Redux, Router, and the list is long.
